# NARoIP (w/ VC3Mod) GDQ2021 EDITION
NieR:Automata Race over Internet Protocol - the *kinda* multiplayer mod? <br>

![Modifications](https://i.imgur.com/cLEBdyD.png)

## What is this?
NARoIP is a mod which adds basic multiplayer-like synchronization between game clients. <br>
Players on a server have their positions and names shared visually in the 3D game-world. <br>
The distance from your own player to other players is also displayed. <br>
This was made specifically with speedrunners in mind. <br>

#### Why no source-code?
This is the sort of private project that incorporates mods from other users, but if you personally ask, I really won't mind providing you with the source code.
